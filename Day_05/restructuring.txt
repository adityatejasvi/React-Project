Generally all the main code in reacr project is put in src folder

Best practice is to make a seperate file for every component

we will keep the component inside src inside component folder

Try to keep the file name same as header component

## some like to put component like .jsx or .txs or .js 
But it is convinent to put .js

## while importing the js files from component it's on you to import as
either without .js or with js name

## Never keep the hard coded data in component file

## Never keep the hard coded String(link) in component file
keep it in seperate file called utilities/common/utils

## There are 2 types of export and import 
-> one is defalut export/import 
-> named import/export

--- Since in a file we can have only one default export
we use named export/import (write import/export as prefix)
